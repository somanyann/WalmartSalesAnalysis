## Revenue And Profit Calculations

$ COGS = unitsPrice * quantity $

$ VAT = 5\% * COGS $

$VAT$ is added to the $COGS$ and this is what is billed to the customer.

$ total(gross_sales) = VAT + COGS $

$ grossProfit(grossIncome) = total(gross_sales) - COGS $

**Gross Margin** is gross profit expressed in percentage of the total(gross profit/revenue)

$ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}} $

<u>**Example with the first row in our DB:**</u>

**Data given:**

- $ \text{Unite Price} = 45.79 $
- $ \text{Quantity} = 7 $

$ COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53 $

$ \text{VAT} = 5\% * COGS\\= 5\%  320.53 = 16.0265 $

$ total = VAT + COGS\\= 16.0265 + 320.53 = $336.5565$

$ \text{Gross Margin Percentage} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}}\\=\frac{16.0265}{336.5565} = 0.047619\\\approx 4.7619\% $
